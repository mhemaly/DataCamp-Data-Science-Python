## Logic, Control Flow and Filtering

Boolean logic is the foundation of decision-making in Python programs. Learn about different comparison operators, how to combine them with Boolean operators, and how to use the Boolean outcomes in control structures. You'll also learn to filter data in pandas DataFrames using logic.

### Equality

```
# Comparison of booleans
True == False

# Comparison of integers
-5 * 15 != 75

# Comparison of strings
'pyscript' == 'PyScript'

# Compare a boolean with an integer
True == 1
```

### Greater and less than

```
# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"

# Comparison of integers
print(x >= -10)
print('test' <= y)
print(True > False)
```

### Compare arrays

```
# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than or equal to 18
print(my_house >= 18)

# my_house less than your_house
print(my_house <= your_house)
```

### and, or, not (1)

```
# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print(my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen < 18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print(my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print(my_kitchen*2 < your_kitchen*3)
```

### Boolean operators with Numpy

```
# Create arrays
import numpy as np
my_house = np.array([18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50])
your_house = np.array([14.0, 24.0, 14.25, 9.0])

# my_house greater than 18.5 or smaller than 10
print(np.logical_or(my_house > 18.5, my_house < 10))

# Both my_house and your_house smaller than 11
print(np.logical_and(my_house < 11, your_house < 11))
```

### Warmup

```
area = 10.0
if(area < 9) :
    print("small")
elif(area < 12) :
    print("medium")
else :
    print("large")
```

### if

```
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
```

### Add else

```
# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else:
    print("pretty small.")
```

### Customize further: elif

```
# Define variables
room = "bed"
area = 14.0

# if-elif-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
elif room == "bed":
    print("looking around in the bedroom.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-elif-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
elif area > 10 :
    print("medium size, nice!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
```

### Driving right (1)

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr = cars['drives_right']

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel = cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(sel)
```

### Driving right (2)

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Convert code to a one-liner
sel = cars[cars['drives_right']]

# Print sel
print(sel)
```

### Cars per capita (1)

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Create car_maniac: observations that have a cars_per_cap over 500
many_cars = cars['cars_per_cap'] > 500
car_maniac = cars[many_cars]

# Print car_maniac
print(car_maniac)
```

### Cars per capita (2)

```
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Import numpy, you'll need this
import numpy as np

# Create medium: observations with cars_per_cap between 100 and 500
cpc = cars['cars_per_cap']
between = np.logical_and(cpc > 100, cpc < 500)
medium = cars[between]

# Print medium
print(medium)
```
