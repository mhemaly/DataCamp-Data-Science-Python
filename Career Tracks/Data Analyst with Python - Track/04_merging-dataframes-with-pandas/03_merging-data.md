## Merging data

You'll learn all about merging pandas DataFrames. You'll explore different techniques for merging, and learn about left joins, right joins, inner joins, and outer joins, as well as when to use which. You'll also learn about ordered merging, which is useful when you want to merge DataFrames with columns that have natural orderings, like date-time columns.

### Merging company DataFrames

```
combined = pd.merge(revenue, managers, on='city')
```

### Merging on a specific column

```
# Merge revenue with managers on 'city': merge_by_city
merge_by_city = pd.merge(revenue, managers, on='city')

# Print merge_by_city
print(merge_by_city)

# Merge revenue with managers on 'branch_id': merge_by_id
merge_by_id = pd.merge(revenue, managers, on='branch_id')

# Print merge_by_id
print(merge_by_id)
```

### Merging on columns with non-matching labels

```
# Merge revenue & managers on 'city' & 'branch': combined
combined = pd.merge(revenue, managers, left_on='city', right_on='branch')

# Print combined
print(combined)
```

### Merging on multiple columns

```
# Add 'state' column to revenue: revenue['state']
revenue['state'] = ['TX','CO','IL','CA']

# Add 'state' column to managers: managers['state']
managers['state'] = ['TX','CO','CA','MO']

# Merge revenue & managers on 'branch_id', 'city', & 'state': combined
combined = pd.merge(revenue, managers, on=['branch_id', 'city', 'state'])

# Print combined
print(combined)
```

### Joining by Index

```
revenue.join(managers, lsuffix='_rev', rsuffix='_mng', how='outer')
```

### Choosing a joining strategy

```
grades = pd.merge(students, midterm_results, how='left')
```

### Left & right merging on multiple columns

```
# Merge revenue and sales: revenue_and_sales
revenue_and_sales = pd.merge(revenue, sales, on=['city','state'], how='right')

# Print revenue_and_sales
print(revenue_and_sales)

# Merge sales and managers: sales_and_managers
sales_and_managers = pd.merge(sales, managers, left_on=['city','state'], right_on=['branch', 'state'], how='left')

# Print sales_and_managers
print(sales_and_managers)
```

### Merging DataFrames with outer join

```
# Perform the first merge: merge_default
merge_default = pd.merge(sales_and_managers, revenue_and_sales)

# Print merge_default
print(merge_default)

# Perform the second merge: merge_outer
merge_outer = pd.merge(sales_and_managers, revenue_and_sales, how='outer')

# Print merge_outer
print(merge_outer)

# Perform the third merge: merge_outer_on
merge_outer_on = pd.merge(sales_and_managers, revenue_and_sales, on=['city','state'], how='outer')

# Print merge_outer_on
print(merge_outer_on)
```

### Using merge_ordered()

```
# Perform the first ordered merge: tx_weather
tx_weather = pd.merge_ordered(austin, houston)

# Print tx_weather
print(tx_weather)

# Perform the second ordered merge: tx_weather_suff
tx_weather_suff = pd.merge_ordered(austin, houston, on='date', suffixes=['_aus','_hus'])

# Print tx_weather_suff
print(tx_weather_suff)

# Perform the third ordered merge: tx_weather_ffill
tx_weather_ffill = pd.merge_ordered(austin, houston, on='date', suffixes=['_aus','_hus'], fill_method='ffill')

# Print tx_weather_ffill
print(tx_weather_ffill)
```

### Using merge_asof()

```
# Merge auto and oil: merged
merged = pd.merge_asof(auto, oil, left_on='yr', right_on='Date')

# Print the tail of merged
print(merged.tail())

# Resample merged: yearly
yearly = merged.resample('A', on='Date')[['mpg','Price']].mean()

# Print yearly
print(yearly)

# print yearly.corr()
print(yearly.corr())
```
