## Importing data from the Internet

The web is a rich source of data from which you can extract various types of insights and findings. In this chapter, you will learn how to get data from the web, whether it is stored in files or in HTML. You'll also learn the basics of scraping and parsing web data.

### Importing flat files from the web: your turn!

```
# Import package
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Save file locally
urlretrieve(url, 'winequality-red.csv')

# Read file into a DataFrame and print its head
df = pd.read_csv('winequality-red.csv', sep=';')
print(df.head())
```

### Opening and reading flat files from the web

```
# Import packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Read file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep=';')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Plot first column of df
pd.DataFrame.hist(df.ix[:, 0:1])
plt.xlabel('fixed acidity (g(tartaric acid)/dm$^3$)')
plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
```

### Importing non-flat files from the web

```
# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/latitude.xls'

# Read in all sheets of Excel file: xls
xls = pd.read_excel(url, sheet_name=None)

# Print the sheetnames to the shell
print(xls.keys())

# Print the head of the first sheet (using its name, NOT its index)
print(xls['1700'].head())
```

### Performing HTTP requests in Python using urllib

```
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# This packages the request: request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Print the datatype of response
print(type(response))

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```

### Printing HTTP request results in Python using urllib

```
# Import packages
from urllib.request import urlopen, Request

# Specify the url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# This packages the request
request = Request(url)

# Sends the request and catches the response: response
response = urlopen(request)

# Extract the response: html
html = response.read()

# Print the html
print(html)

# Be polite and close the response!
response.close()
```

### Performing HTTP requests in Python using requests

```
# Import package
import requests

# Specify the url: url
url = "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation"

# Packages the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response: text
text = r.text

# Print the html
print(text)
```

### Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup

```
# Import packages
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Specify url: url
url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extracts the response as html: html_doc
html_doc = r.text

# Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML: soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

# Prettify the BeautifulSoup object: pretty_soup
pretty_soup = soup.prettify()

# Print the response
print(pretty_soup)
```

### Turning a webpage into data using BeautifulSoup: getting the text

```
# Import packages
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Specify url: url
url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extract the response as html: html_doc
html_doc = r.text

# Create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML: soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

# Get the title of Guido's webpage: guido_title
guido_title = soup.title

# Print the title of Guido's webpage to the shell
print(guido_title)

# Get Guido's text: guido_text
guido_text = soup.get_text()

# Print Guido's text to the shell
print(guido_text)
```

### Turning a webpage into data using BeautifulSoup: getting the hyperlinks

```
# Import packages
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Specify url
url = 'https://www.python.org/~guido/'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Extracts the response as html: html_doc
html_doc = r.text

# create a BeautifulSoup object from the HTML: soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc)

# Print the title of Guido's webpage
print(soup.title)

# Find all 'a' tags (which define hyperlinks): a_tags
a_tags = soup.find_all('a')

# Print the URLs to the shell
for link in a_tags:
    print(link.get('href'))
```
