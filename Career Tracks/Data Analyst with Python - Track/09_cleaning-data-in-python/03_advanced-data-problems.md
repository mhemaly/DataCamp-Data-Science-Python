## Advanced data problems

In this chapter, you’ll dive into more advanced data cleaning problems, such as ensuring that weights are all written in kilograms instead of pounds. You’ll also gain invaluable skills that will help you verify that values have been added correctly and that missing values don’t negatively impact your analyses.

### Uniform currencies

```
# Find values of acct_cur that are equal to 'euro'
acct_eu = banking['acct_cur'] == 'euro'

# Convert acct_amount where it is in euro to dollars
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] = banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_amount'] * 1.1 

# Unify acct_cur column by changing 'euro' values to 'dollar'
banking.loc[acct_eu, 'acct_cur'] = 'dollar'

# Assert that only dollar currency remains
assert banking['acct_cur'].unique() == 'dollar'
```

### Uniform dates

```
# Print the header of account_opend
print(banking['account_opened'].head())

# Convert account_opened to datetime
banking['account_opened'] = pd.to_datetime(banking['account_opened'],
                                           # Infer datetime format
                                           infer_datetime_format = True,
                                           # Return missing value for error
                                           errors = 'coerce') 

# Get year of account opened
banking['acct_year'] = banking['account_opened'].dt.strftime('%Y')

# Print acct_year
print(banking['acct_year'])
```

### How's our data integrity?

```
# Store fund columns to sum against
fund_columns = ['fund_A', 'fund_B', 'fund_C', 'fund_D']

# Find rows where fund_columns row sum == inv_amount
inv_equ = banking[fund_columns].sum(axis=1) == banking['inv_amount']

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
consistent_inv = banking[inv_equ]
inconsistent_inv = banking[~inv_equ]

# Store consistent and inconsistent data
print("Number of inconsistent investments: ", inconsistent_inv.shape[0])
```

### Missing investors

```
   # Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]

# Sort banking by age and visualize
banking_sorted = banking.sort_values('age')
msno.matrix(banking_sorted)
plt.show()
```

### Follow the money

```
# Print number of missing values in banking
print(banking.isna().sum())

# Visualize missingness matrix
msno.matrix(banking)
plt.show()

# Isolate missing and non missing values of inv_amount
missing_investors = banking[banking['inv_amount'].isna()]
investors = banking[~banking['inv_amount'].isna()]

# Sort banking by age and visualize
banking_sorted = banking.sort_values('age')
msno.matrix(banking_sorted)
plt.show()
```
