## Course Description

How do we get from data to answers? Exploratory data analysis is a process for exploring datasets, answering questions, and visualizing results. This course presents the tools you need to clean and validate data, to visualize distributions and relationships between variables, and to use regression models to predict and explain. You'll explore data related to demographics and health, including the National Survey of Family Growth and the General Social Survey. But the methods you learn apply to all areas of science, engineering, and business. You'll use Pandas, a powerful library for working with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy, StatsModels for regression, and Matplotlib for visualization. With these tools and skills, you will be prepared to work with real data, make discoveries, and present compelling results.
