The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights.

To be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL . This course teaches syntax in SQL shared by many types of databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle.
