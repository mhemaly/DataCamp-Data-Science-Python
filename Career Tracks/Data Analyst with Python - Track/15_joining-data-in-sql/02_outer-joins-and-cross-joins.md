## Outer joins and cross joins

In this chapter, you'll come to grips with different kinds of outer joins. You'll learn how to gain further insights into your data through left joins, right joins, and full joins. In addition to outer joins, you'll also work with cross joins.

### Left Join

```
-- Select the city name (with alias), the country code,
-- the country name (with alias), the region,
-- and the city proper population
SELECT c1.name AS city, code, c2.name AS country,
       region, city_proper_pop
-- From left table (with alias)
FROM cities AS c1
  -- Join to right table (with alias)
  INNER JOIN countries AS c2
    -- Match on country code
    ON c1.country_code = c2.code
-- Order by descending country code
ORDER BY code DESC;

SELECT c1.name AS city, code, c2.name AS country,
       region, city_proper_pop
FROM cities AS c1
  -- 1. Join right table (with alias)
  LEFT JOIN countries AS c2
    -- 2. Match on country code
    ON c1.country_code = c2.code
-- 3. Order by descending country code
ORDER BY Code DESC;
```

### Left join (2)

```
/*
5. Select country name AS country, the country's local name,
the language name AS language, and
the percent of the language spoken in the country
*/
SELECT c.name AS country, local_name, l.name AS language, percent
-- 1. From left table (alias as c)
FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join to right table (alias as l)
  LEFT JOIN languages AS l
    -- 3. Match on fields
    ON c.code = l.code
-- 4. Order by descending country
ORDER BY country DESC;
```

### Left join (3)

```
-- 5. Select name, region, and gdp_percapita
SELECT c.name, c.region, e.gdp_percapita
-- 1. From countries (alias as c)
FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Left join with economies (alias as e)
  LEFT JOIN economies AS e
    -- 3. Match on code fields
    ON c.code = e.code
-- 4. Focus on 2010
WHERE year = 2010;

-- Select fields
SELECT c.region, AVG(e.gdp_percapita) AS avg_gdp
-- From countries (alias as c)
FROM countries AS c
  -- Left join with economies (alias as e)
  LEFT JOIN economies AS e
    -- Match on code fields
    ON c.code = e.code
-- Focus on 2010
WHERE year = 2010
-- Group by region
GROUP BY region;

-- Select fields
SELECT region, AVG(gdp_percapita) AS avg_gdp
-- From countries (alias as c)
FROM countries AS c
  -- Left join with economies (alias as e)
  LEFT JOIN economies e
    -- Match on code fields
    ON c.code = e.code
-- Focus on 2010
WHERE year = 2010
-- Group by region
GROUP BY region
-- Order by descending avg_gdp
ORDER BY avg_gdp DESC;
```

### Right join

```
SELECT cities.name AS city, urbanarea_pop, countries.name AS country,
       indep_year, languages.name AS language, percent
FROM languages
  RIGHT JOIN countries
    ON languages.code = countries.code
  RIGHT JOIN cities
    ON countries.code = cities.country_code
ORDER BY city, language;
```

### Full join

```
SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- 3. From countries
FROM countries
  -- 4. Join to currencies
  FULL JOIN currencies
    -- 5. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 1. Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- 2. Order by region
ORDER BY region;

SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
-- 1. From countries
FROM countries
  -- 2. Join to currencies
  LEFT JOIN currencies
    -- 3. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 4. Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- 5. Order by region
ORDER BY region;

SELECT name AS country, code, region, basic_unit
FROM countries
  -- 1. Join to currencies
  INNER JOIN currencies
    USING (code)
-- 2. Where region is North America or null
WHERE region = 'North America' OR region IS NULL
-- 3. Order by region
ORDER BY region;
```

### Full join (2)

```
SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
-- 3. From languages
FROM languages
  -- 4. Join to countries
  FULL JOIN countries
    -- 5. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 1. Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
-- 2. Order by ascending countries.name
ORDER BY countries.name;

SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
FROM languages
  -- 1. Join to countries
  LEFT JOIN countries
    -- 2. Match using code
    USING (code)
-- 3. Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
ORDER BY countries.name;

SELECT countries.name, code, languages.name AS language
FROM languages
  -- 1. Join to countries
  INNER JOIN countries
    USING (code)
-- 2. Where countries.name starts with V or is null
WHERE countries.name LIKE 'V%' OR countries.name IS NULL
ORDER BY countries.name;
```

### Full join (3)

```
-- 7. Select fields (with aliases)
SELECT c.name AS country, region, l.name AS language,
       basic_unit, frac_unit
-- 1. From countries (alias as c1)
FROM countries AS c
  -- 2. Join with languages (alias as l)
  FULL JOIN languages AS l

  FULL JOIN currencies AS c2
    -- 5. Match on code
    USING (code)
-- 6. Where region like Melanesia and Micronesia
WHERE region LIKE 'M%esia';
```

  INNER JOIN languages AS l
    -- 3. Match on country code
    ON c.country_code = l.code
-- 4. Where c.name like Hyderabad
WHERE c.name LIKE 'Hyder%';
```

```
-- Select fields
SELECT c.name AS country, region, life_expectancy AS life_exp
-- From countries (alias as c)
FROM countries AS c
  -- Join to populations (alias as p)
  JOIN populations as p
    -- Match on country code
    ON c.code = p.country_code
-- Focus on 2010
WHERE year = 2010
-- Order by life_exp
ORDER BY life_expectancy
-- Limit to 5 records
LIMIT 5;
