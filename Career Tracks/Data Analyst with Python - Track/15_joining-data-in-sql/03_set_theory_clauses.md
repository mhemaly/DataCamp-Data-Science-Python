## Set theory clauses

In this chapter, you'll learn more about set theory using Venn diagrams and get an introduction to union, union all, intersect, and except clauses. You'll finish by investigating semi joins and anti joins, which provide a nice introduction to subqueries.

### Union

```
-- Select fields from 2010 table
SELECT *
  -- From 2010 table
  FROM economies2010
	-- Set theory clause
	UNION
-- Select fields from 2015 table
SELECT *
  -- From 2015 table
  FROM economies2015
-- Order by code and year
ORDER BY code, year;
```

### Union (2)

```
-- Select field
SELECT country_code
  -- From cities
  FROM cities
	-- Set theory clause
	UNION
-- Select field
SELECT code
  -- From currencies
  FROM currencies
-- Order by country_code
ORDER BY country_code;
```

### Union all

```
-- Select fields
SELECT code, year
  -- From economies
  FROM economies
	-- Set theory clause
	UNION ALL
-- Select fields
SELECT country_code, year
  -- From populations
  FROM populations
-- Order by code, year
ORDER BY code, year;
```

### Intersect

```
-- Select fields
SELECT code, year
  -- From economies
  FROM economies
	-- Set theory clause
	INTERSECT
-- Select fields
SELECT country_code, year
  -- From populations
  FROM populations
-- Order by code and year
ORDER BY code, year;
```

### Intersect (2)

```
-- Select fields
SELECT name
  -- From countries
  FROM countries
	-- Set theory clause
	INTERSECT
-- Select fields
SELECT name
  -- From cities
  from cities;
```

### Except

```
-- Select field
SELECT name
  -- From cities
  FROM cities
	-- Set theory clause
	EXCEPT
-- Select field
SELECT capital
  -- From countries
  FROM countries
-- Order by result
ORDER BY name;
```

### Except (2)

```
-- Select field
SELECT capital
  -- From countries
  FROM countries
	-- Set theory clause
	EXCEPT
-- Select field
SELECT name
  -- From cities
  FROM cities
-- Order by ascending capital
ORDER BY capital;
```

### Semi-join

```
-- Select distinct fields
SELECT DISTINCT name
  -- From languages
  FROM languages
-- Where in statement
WHERE code IN
  -- Subquery
  (SELECT code
   FROM countries
   WHERE region = 'Middle East')
-- Order by name
ORDER BY name;
```

### Diagnosing problems using anti-join

```
-- 3. Select fields
SELECT code, name
  -- 4. From Countries
  FROM countries
  -- 5. Where continent is Oceania
  WHERE continent = 'Oceania'
  	-- 1. And code not in
  	AND NOT code IN
  	-- 2. Subquery
  	(SELECT code
  	 FROM currencies);
```

### Set theory challenge

```
-- Select the city name
SELECT name
  -- Alias the table where city name resides
  FROM cities AS c1
  -- Choose only records matching the result of multiple set theory clauses
  WHERE country_code IN
(
    -- Select appropriate field from economies AS e
    SELECT e.code
    FROM economies AS e
    -- Get all additional (unique) values of the field from currencies AS c2  
    UNION
    SELECT c2.code
    FROM currencies AS c2
    -- Exclude those appearing in populations AS p
    EXCEPT
    SELECT p.country_code
    FROM populations AS p
);
```
