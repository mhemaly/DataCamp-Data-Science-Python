## Basics of Relational Databases

In this chapter, youâ€™ll get acquainted with the fundamentals of relational databases and the relational model for database management. You will learn how to connect to a database and interact with it by writing basic SQL queries, both in raw SQL as well as SQLAlchemy, which provides a Pythonic way of interacting with databases.

### Engines and connection strings

```
# Import create_engine
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine that connects to the census.sqlite file: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Print table names
print(engine.table_names())
```

### Autoloading Tables from a database

```
# Import create_engine, MetaData, and Table
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

# Create engine: engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Create a metadata object: metadata
metadata = MetaData()

# Reflect census table from the engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Print census table metadata
print(repr(census))
```

### Viewing Table details

```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

metadata = MetaData()

# Reflect the census table from the engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Print the column names
print(census.columns.keys())

# Print full metadata of census
print(repr(census))

```

### Selecting data from a Table: raw SQL

```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///census.sqlite')

# Create a connection on engine
connection = engine.connect()

# Build select statement for census table: stmt
stmt = 'SELECT * FROM census'

# Execute the statement and fetch the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)
```

### Selecting data from a Table with SQLAlchemy

```
# Import select
from sqlalchemy import select

# Reflect census table via engine: census
census = Table('census', metadata, autoload=True, autoload_with=engine)

# Build select statement for census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Print the emitted statement to see the SQL string
print(stmt)

# Execute the statement on connection and fetch 10 records: result
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchmany(size=10)

# Execute the statement and print the results
print(results)
```

### Handling a ResultSet

```
# Get the first row of the results by using an index: first_row
first_row = results[0]

# Print the first row of the results
print(first_row)

# Print the first column of the first row by accessing it by its index
print(results[0][0])

# Print the 'state' column of the first row by using its name
print(first_row['state'])
```
