## Applying Filtering, Ordering and Grouping to Queries

In this chapter, you will build on your database knowledge by writing more nuanced queries that allow you to filter, order, and count your dataâ€”all within the Pythonic framework provided by SQLAlchemy.

### Connecting to a PostgreSQL database

```
# Import create_engine function
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to the census database
engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://student:datacamp@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/census')

# Use the .table_names() method on the engine to print the table names
print(engine.table_names())
```

### Filter data selected from a Table - Simple

```
# Create a select query: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Add a where clause to stmt filter the results to only those for New York : stmt_filtered
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state == 'New York')

# Execute the query to retrieve all the data returned: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Loop over the results and print the age, sex, and pop2000
for result in results:
    print(result.age, result.sex, result.pop2000)

```

### Filter data selected from a Table - Expressions

```
# Define a list of states for which we want results
states = ['New York', 'California', 'Texas']

# Create a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to match all the states in_ the list states
stmt = stmt.where(census.columns.state.in_(states))

# Loop over the ResultProxy and print the state and its population in 2000
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.state, result.pop2000)

```

### Filter data selected from a Table - Advanced

```
# Import and_
from sqlalchemy import and_

# Build a query for the census table: stmt
stmt = select([census])

# Append a where clause to select only non-male records from California using and_
stmt = stmt.where(
    # The state of California with a non-male sex
    and_(census.columns.state == 'California',
         census.columns.sex != 'M'
         )
)

# Loop over the ResultProxy printing the age and sex
for result in connection.execute(stmt):
    print(result.age, result.sex)

```

### Ordering by a single column

```
# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by the state column
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the query and store the results: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 results
print(results[:10])

```

### Ordering in descending order by a single column

```
# Import desc
from sqlalchemy import desc

# Build a query to select the state column: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state])

# Order stmt by state in descending order: rev_stmt
rev_stmt = stmt.order_by(desc(census.columns.state))

# Execute the query and store the results: rev_results
rev_results = connection.execute(rev_stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 10 rev_results
print(rev_results[:10])

```

### Ordering by multiple columns

```
# Build a query to select state and age: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, census.columns.age])

# Append order by to ascend by state and descend by age
stmt = stmt.order_by(census.columns.state, desc(census.columns.age))

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print the first 20 results
print(results[:20])

```

### Counting distinct data

```
# Build a query to count the distinct states values: stmt
stmt = select([func.count(census.columns.state.distinct())])

# Execute the query and store the scalar result: distinct_state_count
distinct_state_count = connection.execute(stmt).scalar()

# Print the distinct_state_count
print(distinct_state_count)

```

### Count of records by state

```
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build a query to select the state and count of ages by state: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, func.count(census.columns.age)])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
print(results[0].keys())

```

### Determining the population sum by state

```
# Import func
from sqlalchemy import func

# Build an expression to calculate the sum of pop2008 labeled as population
pop2008_sum = func.sum(census.columns.pop2008).label('population')

# Build a query to select the state and sum of pop2008: stmt
stmt = select([census.columns.state, pop2008_sum])

# Group stmt by state
stmt = stmt.group_by(census.columns.state)

# Execute the statement and store all the records: results
results = connection.execute(stmt).fetchall()

# Print results
print(results)

# Print the keys/column names of the results returned
print(results[0].keys())
```

### ResultsSets and pandas DataFrames

```
# import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)
```

### From SQLAlchemy results to a plot

```
# Import pyplot as plt from matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a DataFrame from the results: df
df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Set Column names
df.columns = results[0].keys()

# Print the DataFrame
print(df)

# Plot the DataFrame
df.plot.bar()
plt.show()

```
