# Build a histogram (3): compare
# In the video, you saw population pyramids for the present day and for the future. Because we were using a histogram, it was very easy to make a comparison.
#
# Let's do a similar comparison. life_exp contains life expectancy data for different countries in 2007. You also have access to a second list now, life_exp1950, containing similar data for 1950. Can you make a histogram for both datasets?
#
# You'll again be making two plots. The plt.show() and plt.clf() commands to render everything nicely are already included. Also matplotlib.pyplot is imported for you, as plt.
#
# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Build a histogram of life_exp with 15 bins.
# Build a histogram of life_exp1950, also with 15 bins. Is there a big difference with the histogram for the 2007 data?
