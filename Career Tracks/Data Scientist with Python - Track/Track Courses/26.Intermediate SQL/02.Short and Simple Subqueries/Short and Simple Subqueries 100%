Filtering using scalar subqueries:
-- Select the average of home + away goals, multiplied by 3
SELECT 
	3 * avg(home_goal + away_goal)
FROM matches_2013_2014;

SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals scored
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM  matches_2013_2014
-- Filter for matches where total goals exceeds 3x the average
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >
       (SELECT 3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
        FROM matches_2013_2014);         


Filtering using a subquery with a list:
SELECT 
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team 
-- Exclude all values from the subquery
WHERE team_api_id  not in
     (select DISTINCT hometeam_id  FROM match);
     

Filtering with more complex subquery conditions:
SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id in
	  (SELECT hometeam_id 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);
 
 
Joining Subqueries in FROM:
SELECT 
	-- Select the country ID and match ID
	country_id,
    id
FROM match
-- Filter for matches with 10 or more goals in total
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10;

SELECT
	-- Select country name and the count match IDs
    name AS country_name,
    COUNT(sub.id) AS matches
FROM country AS c
-- Inner join the subquery onto country
-- Select the country id and match id columns
inner join (SELECT country_id,id 
           FROM match
           -- Filter the subquery by matches with 10+ goals
           WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10) AS sub
ON c.id = sub.country_id
GROUP BY country_name;


Building on Subqueries in FROM:
SELECT
	-- Select country, date, home, and away goals from the subquery
    country,
    subq.date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal
FROM 
	-- Select country name, date, and total goals in the subquery
	(SELECT c.name AS country, 
     	    m.date, 
     		m.home_goal, 
     		m.away_goal,
           (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN country AS c
    ON m.country_id = c.id) AS subq
-- Filter by total goals scored in the main query
WHERE total_goals >=10;


Add a subquery to the SELECT clause:
SELECT 
	l.name AS league,
    -- Select and round the league's total goals
    ROUND(avg(m.home_goal + m.away_goal), 2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Select & round the average total goals for the season
    (SELECT round(avg(home_goal + away_goal), 2)

FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Filter for the 2013/2014 season
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY league;


Subqueries in Select for Calculations:
SELECT    
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
	ROUND(avg(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Subtract the overall average from the league average
	ROUND(avg(home_goal + m.away_goal) - 
		(SELECT avg(home_goal + away_goal)
		 FROM match 
         WHERE season = '2013/2014'),2) AS diff
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Only include 2013/2014 results
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY l.name;


ALL the Subqueries EVERYWHERE:

Add a subquery in SELECT:
SELECT

	s.stage,
    ROUND(s.avg_goals,2) AS avg_goal,
