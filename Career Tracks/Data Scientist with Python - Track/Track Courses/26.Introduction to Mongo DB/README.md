# [Introduction to MongoDB in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-using-mongodb-for-data-science-with-python)

## Course Description

MongoDB is a tool to explore data structured as you see fit. As a NoSQL database, it doesn't follow the strict relational format imposed by SQL. By providing capabilities that typically require adding layers to SQL, it collapses complexity. With dynamic schema, you can handle vastly different data together and consolidate analytics. The flexibility of MongoDB empowers you to keep improving and fix issues as your requirements evolve. In this course, you will learn the MongoDB language and apply it to search and analytics. Working with unprocessed data from the official nobelprize.org API, you will explore and answer questions about Nobel Laureates and prizes.
