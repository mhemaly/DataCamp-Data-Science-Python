Apply the foundational Python skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.
My notes on Datacamp Projects (on jupyter notebooks)


## Project Description:

In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.


## Project Tasks:

1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?
