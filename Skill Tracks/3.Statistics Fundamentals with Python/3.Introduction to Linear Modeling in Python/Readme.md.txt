#H2 Course Description

One of the primary goals of any scientist is to find patterns in data and build models to describe, predict, and extract insight from those patterns.
The most fundamental of these patterns is a linear relationship between two variables.
This course provides an introduction to exploring, quantifying, and modeling linear relationships in data, by demonstrating techniques such as least-squares, linear regression, estimatation, and bootstrap resampling.
Here you will apply the most powerful modeling tools in the python data science ecosystem, including scipy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn, to build and evaluate linear models.
By exploring the concepts and applications of linear models with python, this course serves as both a practical introduction to modeling, and as a foundation for learning more advanced modeling techniques and tools in statistics and machine learning.
